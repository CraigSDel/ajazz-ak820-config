# Manual Test Plan — AK820 Pro Configurator

Run with the real keyboard plugged in via USB-C (wired mode preferred for first test).

## Pre-flight

- Browser: Chrome stable (>= 134) or Edge stable.
- Keyboard: AJAZZ AK820 Pro, plugged in via USB-C, **wired mode** switch.
- Dev server running (`npm run dev`) and page open at `http://localhost:5173/ajazz-ak820-config/`.

## Tests

### T1 — Connection

1. Click **Connect keyboard**.
2. WebHID picker appears; select "AJAZZ AK820 Pro" (or equivalent label).
3. UI shows "Status: Connected".

Pass criteria: no error toast, panels become enabled.

### T2 — Time sync

1. Click **Sync now** in the Time panel.
2. Observe the TFT screen.

Pass criteria: TFT clock updates to host system time within ~1 minute.

### T3 — Static image

1. Pick a PNG file ~512×512.
2. Confirm the preview shows the complete image fitted into 128×128 with dominant-color padding.
3. Click **Upload to keyboard**.
4. Observe TFT.

Pass criteria: progress bar advances to 100%, image appears on TFT (orientation, colors, aspect should match preview).

### T4 — Static image — non-square

1. Pick a PNG that is 1000×400 (wide).
2. Verify the entire image remains visible with dominant-color padding above and below.
3. Upload.

Pass criteria: TFT shows the same fitted image and letterboxing as the preview.

For a transparent PNG or GIF, verify the app does not add dominant-color
padding. Transparent areas and unused space should resolve to black because the
TFT's RGB565 format cannot carry an alpha channel.

### T5 — Animated GIF

1. Pick a small GIF (~3-10 frames).
2. Preview shows first frame.
3. Upload.

Pass criteria: TFT animates with timings approximately matching the GIF.

Repeat with an animated WebP. It should also upload as multiple frames with
approximately matching timings; a static WebP should remain a static upload.

### T6 — Disconnect mid-upload

1. Start uploading a GIF (T5).
2. Unplug USB during upload.
3. UI shows error, progress halts.
4. Re-plug, click Connect, retry upload.

Pass criteria: app recovers cleanly; second upload succeeds.

### T7 — Re-visit

1. Close the tab.
2. Reopen the URL.
3. Click Connect.

Pass criteria: no permission re-prompt (origin-scoped permission persists).

### T8 — Static red lighting

1. In Lighting, select **Static**, choose red (`#ff0000`), brightness 5, and
   click **Apply lighting**.

Pass criteria: all keyboard lighting becomes steady red and the UI reports
"Lighting applied".

### T9 — Lighting off and rainbow

1. Select **Off** and apply; confirm all key lighting turns off.
2. Select **Spectrum**, enable **Rainbow**, and apply.

Pass criteria: off fully disables lighting and Spectrum starts a rainbow effect.

### T10 — Direction encoding

1. Select **Scrolling**, apply once with Up and once with Down.
2. Select **Rolling**, apply once with Left and once with Right.

Pass criteria: every direction matches its label. If Up and Down are reversed,
record it before changing the protocol mapping because the two reference
implementations disagree on those byte values.

### T11 — Lighting sleep timeout

1. Select **1 minute** and click **Apply sleep timeout**.
2. Leave the keyboard idle without pressing keys.

Pass criteria: keyboard lighting turns off after approximately one minute.

### T11a — Custom RGB capability and backup

1. Connect PID `0x8009`, then repeat with PID `0x800a`.
2. Confirm diagnostics show USB ID and `0xFF67 framed commands`.
3. Click **Read and back up current layout**.
4. Record whether reading changes any keyboard lighting (it must not).

Pass criteria: the current table loads without a write and Restore becomes
available only after a valid backup exists.

### T11b — LED mapping and restoration

1. Save the current state using T11a.
2. Clear the editor, paint only Esc red, apply, and verify only Esc changes.
3. Repeat with Q, Space, ISO key, arrows, Delete, End, Page Up, and Page Down.
4. Test WASD and arrow group selection.
5. Click **Restore previous lighting**.

Pass criteria: every visual key maps to the expected physical LED and the
previous effect and colors return. Record layout/locale and any mismatched ID.

### T11c — Custom RGB persistence and write discipline

1. Apply one static custom layout.
2. Reload the page without applying again, then reconnect and power-cycle.
3. Confirm painting, undo/redo, presets, and local profile changes cause no HID
   traffic until Apply is pressed.

Pass criteria: persistence behavior is documented and there are no background
or rapid repeated writes.

### T12 — Shared operation safety

1. Start a large animated image upload.
2. While it runs, inspect Time, Lighting, Sleep, and connection controls.
3. Repeat, unplugging the keyboard during the upload.

Pass criteria: other device actions are disabled and the active operation is
shown. After disconnect, the operation indicator clears and reconnect works.

## Known protocol risks

The protocol byte layouts in `src/protocol/image.ts` use the AKS075/Windows-driver framing (sub-command `0x03`, 4096-byte chunks, 256-byte frame header). If T3/T4/T5 fail, the alternative gohv/AK820-Pro framing is documented in `docs/protocol-notes.md` under "gohv / AK820 Pro alternate framing" (sub-command `0x02`, 4123-byte chunks, no 256-byte header, plus a `FINISH` packet `04 F0` at the end). Adjusting `src/protocol/image.ts` to that framing requires updating the corresponding fixture in `src/protocol/__tests__/`.

If T2 fails, the time-sync layout is unambiguous across all three reference repos — first check WebHID permission and that the keyboard is in wired mode, not the keyboard protocol.
